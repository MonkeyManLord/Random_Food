# Random_Food
Website with python backend - website generates a random food in specific category (lunch, dinner, etc) and gives all detail on how to make it

Goals: user friendly website layout, website is hosted using pythonAnywhere.
   User is first instructed to select their type of meal (breakfast, lunch, dinner, or dessert)
       Big green button that says "Generate My Meal!", once clicked does the following:
            displays picture of meal that embeds the link to its youtube video,
            displays name with country of origin,
            a description,
            a "How to make" dropdown button that extends the page and houses the ingredients followed by a youtube link to how to make it then, the instructions.
            at the bottom of the page is the source.
-Getters for all of these variables have been initialized as functions already-
-website format (prototype) has also been provided as a folder in this repo-


future goals: button on top nav bar that links to a website that they can order it to their door (ubereats, doordash... etc)
              (maybe): add a ui aspect that has a "Open youtube" button]
